## User story
Did you know that the number of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing dramatically fast? It’s to the point that in places like Austin, there are not enough schools to place all the kids. There are people who learn how to treat their children through someone else’s stories (and through therapists of course). So, what if there was a forum dedicated to the parents of ASD children to post stories and get advice from people in the same situation as them?
